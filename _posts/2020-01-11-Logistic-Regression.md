- **main difference between them is how they are being used**
  <br>
  The Linear Regression is used for **solving Regression problems** whereas Logistic Regression is used for **solving the Classification problems**.

    <td>The output for Linear Regression must be a <b>continuous value</b>, such as price, age, etc.</td>
  	<td>The output of Logistic Regression must be a <b>Categorical value</b> such as 0 or 1, Yes or No, etc.</td>

  <tr>
  	<td>In Linear regression, it is required that relationship between dependent variable and independent variable must be linear.</td>
  	<td>In Logistic regression, it is not required to have the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.</td>

  <tr>
  	<td>In linear regression, there may be collinearity between the independent variables.</td>
  	<td>In logistic regression, there should not be collinearity between the independent variable.</td>
